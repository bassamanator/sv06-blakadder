Mine was quite bad and lots of filament got between the heat block and sock and ended up covering the delicate wiring for the thermistor. Sovol was kind enough to send me a replacement hot end which was greatly appreciated. What I noticed about the replacement is that part of the silicone sock is trimmed away making space for the wire for the heat cartridge. Prior to the revision, the wire was pushing down one corner of the sock causing it to fit poorly. I would have to constantly pull it up but during a print it would sag back down. Like wearing loose pants and pulling it up all the time. My guess is that the sock came down during my unattended print and once it caught a bit of melted filament it blobbed. From my picture of the new vs old you can see they've trimmed the corner. My advice here is if you have one side of the sock sagging down, remove it and trim a tiny bit to make clearance for the cartridge wiring. Hopefully this saves you any potential issue that I experienced.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact","text":"<p>You can leave suggestions via email or comments which use GitHub Discussions</p> <p>Please send your suggestions and links to guides/troubleshooting not covered here</p>"},{"location":"firmware/","title":"Firmware for SV06","text":""},{"location":"firmware/#how-to-flash-firmware","title":"How to Flash Firmware","text":"<p>Video instructions</p> <p>Troubleshooting steps if you cannot flash the new firmware:</p> <ul> <li>firmware file is the only file on the SD Card</li> <li>rename the firmware file to something unique</li> <li>change extension to <code>.BIN</code> (capital letters)</li> <li>make sure the SD Card is less than 16Gb and formatted as FAT32 4096 blocks</li> </ul>"},{"location":"firmware/#marlin","title":"Marlin","text":""},{"location":"firmware/#sovol-firmware","title":"Sovol Firmware","text":"<p>Original Sovol firmware</p> <p>Download Source</p>"},{"location":"firmware/#hillsoftwares-build","title":"hillsoftware's build","text":"<p>Custom Sovol SV06 build with options for UBL, Bi-Linear, Manual Mesh, Input Shaping, and X-Twist</p> <p>Download Source</p>"},{"location":"firmware/#blastrocks-build","title":"blastrock's build","text":"<p>This is an attempt at cleaning up branches from various other firmwares while providing a working Marlin 2.1.2 firmware with X-Twist compensation support.</p> <p>Download</p>"},{"location":"firmware/#th3d-unified-2-firmware","title":"TH3D Unified 2 Firmware","text":"<p>https://support.th3dstudio.com/helpcenter/sovol-sv06-firmware/</p>"},{"location":"firmware/#klipper","title":"Klipper","text":""},{"location":"firmware/#one-stop-shop-klipper-configuration","title":"One-Stop-Shop Klipper Configuration","text":"<p>A comprehensive Klipper configuration for multiple variants of the Sovol SV06.</p>"},{"location":"firmware/#supports","title":"Supports","text":"<ul> <li>SV06</li> <li>SV06 Plus</li> <li>SV06 with the BTT SKR-Mini-E3-V3.0</li> <li>And other printers as well</li> </ul>"},{"location":"firmware/#sovol-klipper-screen","title":"Sovol Klipper Screen","text":"<p>Sovol original touch screen with Klipper preinstalled, like the one used in Sovol SV07.</p> <p>Buy from</p> <p>Sovol store</p>"},{"location":"firmware/#pr20100-klipper-profile","title":"Pr20100+ Klipper profile","text":"<p>Complete Klipper profile with all config files and macros to tune the Sovol SV06 (stock).</p> <p>https://github.com/Pr20100/SOVOL-SV06-Klipper-profile</p>"},{"location":"firmware/#spinixguys-build","title":"spinixguy's build","text":"<p>https://github.com/spinixguy/Sovol-SV06-firmware</p>"},{"location":"firmware/#enable-buzzer-macro","title":"Enable Buzzer Macro","text":"<p>Want to use the beeper (M300) G-Code to alert you?</p> <p>Add this to your macros in Klipper:</p> <pre><code>######################################################################\n# Beeper\n######################################################################\n# M300 : Play tone.

Mine was quite bad and lots of filament got between the heat block and sock and ended up covering the delicate wiring for the thermistor. Sovol was kind enough to send me a replacement hotend which was greatly appreciated. What I noticed about the replacement is that part of the silicone sock is trimmed away making space for the wire for the heat cartridge. Prior to the revision, the wire was pushing down one corner of the sock causing it to fit poorly. I would have to constantly pull it up but during a print it would sag back down. Like wearing loose pants and pulling it up all the time. My guess is that the sock came down during my unattended print and once it caught a bit of melted filament it blobbed. From my picture of the new vs old you can see they've trimmed the corner. My advice here is if you have one side of the sock sagging down, remove it and trim a tiny bit to make clearance for the cartridge wiring. Hopefully this saves you any potential issue that I experienced.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Plus/issues/#filament-sensor-causes-print-issues","title":"Filament sensor causes print issues","text":"<p>Due to the filament sensor design it can create a lot of strain on the filament path to the point that the extruder cannot pull the filament and you get under extrusion print issues.</p> <p>@mak77 created a printable mod for the filament sensor that ensures a more natural path for the filament.</p> <p>There are other mounting options using a bearing designed by @Lars</p>"},{"location":"Plus/parts-plus/","title":"Parts List","text":""},{"location":"Plus/parts-plus/#tool-head","title":"Tool Head","text":""},{"location":"Plus/parts-plus/#complete-kit","title":"Complete Kit","text":"<p>Complete toolhead including the extruder, hot end, bed probe and fans.
